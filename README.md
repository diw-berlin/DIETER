A Dispatch and Investment Evaluation Tool with Endogenous Renewables "DIETER"

The Dispatch and Investment Evaluation Tool with Endogenous Renewables (DIETER) has been developed in the research project StoRES to study the role of power storage and other flexibility options in a greenfield setting with high shares of renewables. The model determines cost-minimizing combinations of power generation, demand-side management, and storage capacities and their respective dispatch. DIETER thus captures multiple system values of power storage related to arbitrage, firm capacity, and reserves.

We are happy to receive your feedback.

The model is implemented in the General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS). Running the model thus requires a GAMS system, an LP solver, and respective licenses. We use the commercial solver CPLEX, but other LP solvers work, as well.
